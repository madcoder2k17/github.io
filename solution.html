					    In order to end this cycle of unemployment and deficit, America needs to institute changes which will push education as a priority. These changes should include investing more in education, increasing funding to schools and teachers, and provide germane curriculums and adjustments to current practices.
	<br><br>First, increasing funding to teachers and schools will make teaching a job that is secure and desirable and allows schools to promote programs and educational institutions that further a student's education. Right now, a teacher is paid around $55,000 per year (not including taxes). This is hard to sustain a family and also have spare cash to pursue interests outside of teaching. Considering teachers are the keystone of the education system in every country, teachers need to be given better treatment. Many people are passionate about teaching and very bright individuals, but it is so difficult being a teacher with poor treatment. Invest more money in teachers, not in other less important endeavors. Compare this to the Chinese education system. Teachers are given a lot of respect, have a higher salary, do not have to pay taxes from their salary, and have their own holiday. This attributes a lot to the success of the Chinese education system and how much higher their standards are. People can pursue a profession as a teacher and live a more comfortable life and thus more people can teach higher level material. If teachers were given higher salaries, standards could be raised because there would be more teachers to teach more advanced subjects. 
	<br><br>Second, investing more in education will not only help schools, teachers, and students, but will provide long term rewards. According to a TEDx Talk by Sue Khim, CEO of Brilliant.Org, "harnessing the human capital can move the GDP [a measurement of how much goods a country produces] of entire countries." For example, in 1960, Singapore and Jamaica had a similar GDP. Jamaica focused on agriculture, while Singapore invested in education programs. Now, Singapore has a much larger GDP, is fully developed, and is a major producer of electronics and other products. Essentially, focusing more funds on education means a brighter future. 
	<br><br>Finally, practices in the current education system must be adjusted. For example, stopping the segregation of "high performance" and "low performance" students. What is meant by this is that if, for example, a student performs poorly in a math class, it is thought "this student isn't a math type" and is moved to a lower math class. This makes it hard for this student to learn challenging material just because they do not have a natural aptitude. Ideologies in other countries like China and Singapore are that every student has the capabilities to achieve in any class no matter their natural aptitude as long as they put in the effort. This practice is better because it allows even those who do not have natural talent to soak up the necessary material and succeed rather than be shoved into a class and lose all motivation they would have had. 
	<br><br>Obviously, implementing these programs would have several logistic challenges such as the price of implementing these systems and making adjustments to the education system. However, it is possible to adjust to these systems over time. As said, investing in education is a well paying investment that will exponentially increase GDP over time. Furthermore, there are many wasteful programs that champion unnecessary technology or other practices that can be cut to spend money on what is necessary: increasing the salary of teachers, and raising the standards. Overall, education is an investment worth making regardless of the initial price and logistic challenges.
