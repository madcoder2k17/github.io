					<h2>The Problem</h2>
					<p>Without investing in education, America will continue in a cycle of 
					low standards and unemployment</p>

					    Low education standards in the United States make it difficult to fill the jobs that are both necessary and essential for the future. For example, the requirement to graduate from a high school in California is to complete one year of Algebra I. Considering learning Algebra I  in middle school is the norm in many European or Asian countries, it is easy to see why standards are lacking. Many lucrative jobs requiring high technical skill like engineers and mechanics have unfilled roles because there simply aren't enough qualified people to take the job. Is it right that people ready to join an expanding workforce with ever more technical jobs to have only a math background up to Algebra I? Obviously, this is an extreme; the majority of people will do mathematics above Algebra I, but it brings an idea of how well American education fares with many other countries. It is necessary to stretch standards to accommodate for the ever increasing amount of skill required in the workforce. While this is not a silver bullet to cure the problems of the current education system, it should bolster the economy and help supply technical jobs.
	<br><br>If the standards in the United States remain the same, this will have negative ramifications on the entire country. People will remain unemployed and more people will be stuck living off low-income jobs that require few skills. As of February 2015, America's average unemployment rate stands at 5.5%, with a portion of jobs being unskilled and low paying. However, some states may have as much as over 7% unemployment rate. This is because people are not meeting the requirements for skilled jobs that they either need to support themselves or want to have, and end up being unemployed because there are few jobs they can qualify for. Without raising standards, many people will lack the education they will need for a well paying career. If standards are not strengthened and more money is not invested into education, America will be stuck in a deficit with a portion of the country struggling to make an income.
